Given a character name, what are the names of the films they have been in?

	Given a character name-> How do you know their ID number?
			I looped over ID Numbers and collected all the names and made a map
	
	Given an ID number, can we find all the movie titles for that person?
		1. Build the URL
		2. Go to the person (with the API?)
			We use MakeGETRequest
		3. Now we have JSON
		4. We make a DTO
		5. THen we map the JSON to the DTO
		6. Find the Film Links
		7. Click each Link
			Then get the titles

	




	From the film link, get the title
		I need: JSON and a DTO
		Where does the JSON come from?
			From the API
				How do we get it?
					URL (Make a GET request with http)
		Once I have the JSON, I can build the DTO
		Then I can use the Mapper
		THEN I can get the title
