Make a n-sized tic-tac-toe game with a save/load feature if you can't finish a game and want to come back to it

Terminal based game (no GUI)

Board
	nXn

Scanner

Players

For Loops/While loops?
	while (board.determineWinner == Result.KEEP_GOING){
		keep playing/take a turn
	}


Objects we'll need:

	Play Class
		Init Players (determine 2 players or 1 vs comp)
		Turn tracker -> two booleans
			Maybe 1 boolean -> isPlayer1sTurn
		Main method
			While loop

	Player Class
		Symbol (x or o) (any symbol?) 
		PutOnBoard(board object)
			SUBCLASS: ComputerPlayer
				PutOnBoard(board object)
					randomly chooses an open spot

	Board Class
		constructor
			brand new game
			load an old game

		Grid of spots
		2D Array -> of Strings

		makeMove(row, col, symbol)

		See the board (method)
			toString()
			DisplayWithLabels()

		Result determineWinner(){
			p1 wins
			p2 wins
			draw
			absence of a winner (keep playing?)
		}

	Result enum
		P1_WINS
		P2_WINS
		DRAW
		KEEP_PLAYING

	Saver/Loader class
		static methods: 
			save (board)
				User input the file name?
			load (read in the file and return a populated board)
