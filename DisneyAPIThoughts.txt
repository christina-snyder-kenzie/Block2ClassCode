If I tell you the name of a disney movie, can you show me pictures of the cast?
	(No, you cannot google it)

1. We need to find out the movie
	Scanner
2. Build the URL
3. Make a DTO
4. Make an HTTP Request to get the JSON
5. Map the JSON to the DTO
5.2. I want to see the names of the characters

6. Compile the IMG URLs
7. Write to an HTML File
8. Rejoice with lemons



The Cast Names
	Build a URL with a film query
