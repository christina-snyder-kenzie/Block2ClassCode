        /*
        Variable Naming Rules & Conventions
        Rule (Something that ALWAYS MUST Happen)
        1. NO SPACES
        2. AlphaNumeric (letters + numbers but also _ and I think $)
        3. Must begin with a letter (or an underscore)
            CANNOT start with a number
        4. Cannot use a reserved word (the orange ones)
        Convention (a suggestion)
        1. camelCase whereYouCapitalizeTheFirstLetterOfEachWord
            sometimes you'll see '_' used as a space (MAX_VALUE)
        2. variables usually start with a lowerCase letter
            FileNames usually start with a capital letter
        3. Descriptive
